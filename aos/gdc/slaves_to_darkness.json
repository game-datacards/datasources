She is a warrior of matchless willpower, convinced that there is no challenge she cannot best through bloody-minded grit. To Abraxia, Chaos represents a state of perpetual testing rather than being embodied in four insane gods. Such an anti-deific attitude pleases Archaon, who offers Abraxia that rarest of boons – a measure of his trust. In her conquest of the Sigmarite city of the Phoenicium, Abraxia consumed the sacred fire at the bastion’s heart. Cinder now flickers when she speaks, while in her eyes rages a tortured and captive flame.",
