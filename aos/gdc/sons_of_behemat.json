      "fluff": "Beast-smashers are considered, even by other gargants, to be a touch mad. In truth, they are more susceptible to the energy of the Waaagh! than most of their kin. It stains their vision green and opens their souls to a rough elemental power, leading them to believe that they can hear Gorkamorka talking to them – or even that they are the god himself. Either way, their goal is the same: to slaughter great beasts, just as Gorkamorka once did.\n\nA Beast-smasher wades into battle without hesitation, unconcerned with the smaller enemies they either squash underfoot, catch with idle swings of their huge menhir clubs or snatch up to eat without conscious thought. Though they may eventually be brought down by a thousand cuts, a Beast-smasher will ignore all but the most punishing blows, convinced of their own godly invincibility. When tangling with worthy prey, Beast-smashers display a startling killer instinct. They know how to dodge between a hydra’s heads and tie their necks into a knot, how to wrestle a Black Dragon’s jaws shut so it cannot unleash its noxious breath, and how to cave in a rival gargant’s breastbone with one strike.",

With a bellow of hate, a Gatebreaker advances on an enemy settlement without fear, shrugging off panicked arrows and cannon fire with little more than a malicious chuckle.\n\nAs they approach, the Gatebreaker begins to swing their fortcrusha flail – a brutal weapon cobbled together from the wreckage of sundered cities – with terrible, mounting velocity. This flail can be used to hook onto the crenellations of a city’s battlements; with a flex of their immense muscles, the Gatebreaker uses this leverage to tear down an entire wall, laughing at the roar of collapsing stonework and the screams of defenders tumbling to their doom. Then the Mega-Gargant shoulders their way through the rubble and into the city, and the slaughter truly begins.",

Brodd becomes a bellowing icon of savagery in battle, invigorating fellow gargants through the bestial energy that clings to him.\n\nLong did Brodd reign as king of the Scabrous Sprawl in Ghyran. Many believed that his relative intelligence resulted from some blessing of the dormant godbeast Behemat. During the Realmgate Wars, the gargants of the Sprawl formed an alliance with the Stormcast Eternals. When Sigmar’s chosen told him of Archaon’s plan to bind Behemat into service, Brodd agreed to help them fight back. He was thus close at hand to witness Behemat at last awaken – and when Sigmar’s champion murdered the godbeast, Brodd could do nothing but watch helplessly.\n\nNow Brodd sees himself as a holy avenger charged with trampling the empires of the hated God-King flat. He eagerly joins the warpath of other stomps, especially if they lead to Sigmar’s cities; few would deny the aid of the elder king, for they recognise that the best fights follow him.",

From their number rose a champion so powerful that he ascended to godhood: Kragnos, the End of Empires. Having led his people in warfare against a draconic empire that left the Drogrukh all but extinct, Kragnos was sealed away for the protection of the realms – only to be freed centuries later. Though he currently wages a protracted war in the Realm of Life, Kragnos can still be drawn to battle by the most ferocious fighting, his arrival announced by the smashing of enemy lines and the crushing of foes under his thunderous hooves.\n\nAlready a natural disaster made manifest, Kragnos’s rampages are further augmented by his legendary armaments. The shield Tuskbreaker is said to have been cast aside by Gorkamorka himself, deity of the orruks and other brutish beings. The spells of enemy mages break instantly upon its surface, supposedly due to the residual divine essence that suffuses it. The Dread Mace, Kragnos’s massive studded club, is powerful enough to shatter walls of solid rock. Legends say that Kragnos retrieved the weapon’s head from an ancient geomantic nexus, and that it is infused with Ghur’s own destructive animus.",

Though extremely acquisitive, most Kraken-eaters will not make any effort to use their prizes, other than carrying them around in huge nets or haphazard bandoliers. However, there are those who propose a wild notion: not everything made by pipsqueaks is worthless. These Kraken-eaters attempt to actually understand the contents of their hoards, and the cleverest have deduced that magic is a powerful force. While the manipulation of arcane energies is a bit too finicky for gargants, an artefact that does it for them is another matter, so they collect any mystical doodads they can.\n\nDespite their hermetic existence, Kraken-eaters are still gargants at heart. The need to destroy and stake their territory is strong, as is their newly acquired desire to pillage treasure. Dark legends tell of them submerging their massive forms below the sea then snatching ships from the water’s surface in order to drown or eat everyone aboard.",

While they have yet to reach the awe-inspiring proportions of the Mega-Gargants, they are not to be taken lightly; even an adolescent Mancrusher will loom over a Sigmarite domicile and can snatch up a fleeing settler with one grasp of their meaty hands. Many carry gore-stained burlap sacks and will stuff both living and dead prey into the meaty churn within to save for a treat after the battle is won.\n\nBecause they do not need to dominate a local food supply to the same extent as their larger kin, Mancrushers are often especially sociable by gargant standards. It is common to see mobs of the brutes banding together beneath the biggest of their number, hunting together and showing off to see who is the greatest. Just as common is the mob later having some catastrophic falling-out over the distribution of spoils or an accusation of foul play in some oafish game and battering one another to a pulp.",

The charge of a Warstomper is akin to being hit by a roaring Chamonic steam-engine, and then the titan begins swinging their huge club, ploughing through enemy ranks with howls of battle-joy. Warstompers regularly fight as mercenaries in the service of Chaos, for the society of the Dark Gods’ worshippers is predicated upon endless strife, and that suits these gargants just fine.\n\nIt is tempting to think of the Warstompers as stone-headed brutes, incapable of higher thought beyond flailing their limbs in a frenzy. Their passion for battle, however, translates to a frightening degree of comprehension. While raw strength is usually enough to win the day, they have a basic but uncanny understanding of tactics, recognising when to fight, when to pull back and when to redouble their efforts. Should they be fired on by archers, the Warstomper will raise one arm as a shield to protect their vital organs. If they are charged by cavalry, the gargants will shake the earth with heavy jumps, breaking the momentum of the mounted unit. Some Warstompers will even set aside their pride to feign injury when confronted by a powerful adversary, only to strike once their prey’s focus lapses.",
