They resemble huge gastropods, albeit with fronds of tentacles undulating around their heads and clusters of pus-weeping eyes blinking across their faces. Their blubbery bodies leave a trail of corrosive sludge, and when a beast collides with an enemy formation, the impact smashes bones to powder. Even more unnatural than a Beast of Nurgle’s appearance, however, is the joy that pervades these daemons. They are extremely, idiotically affectionate, always on the lookout for new playmates. Such is their enthusiasm that they cannot distinguish a mortal’s cries of pain as they dissolve from whoops of excitement.\n\nBeasts of Nurgle are one of the few breeds of daemon who truly lack any form of malice. This, however, does not diminish their lethal potential. Though they are far too excitable to follow orders or hold positions, the masters of the Plague Legions can always rely on the Beasts’ witless enthusiasm to create carnage. Beasts of Nurgle have little in the way of attention span, and become disappointed when the target of their affection becomes all still and boring – yet this is quickly rectified whenever the daemon spies another potential friend in the distance.",

They are clear marks of Nurgle’s esteem, and each Maggoth Lord commands hordes of faithful as a result.\n\nAs a child, the mortal who would become Bloab Rotspawned delighting in tormenting flies and maggots – beasts for which Nurgle has long held an affinity. It was a habit that persisted even as Bloab grew into a feared warlord, until at last the god’s ire peaked. In a single terrible night, Bloab’s body was infested with buzzing drones, until he became little more than an undulating sack of flesh filled with insects. Not for nothing is it said that Bloab is the swarm and the swarm is Bloab. The Lord of Daemon Flies now seeks to spread his swarm-brothers across the realms, using sorcery to conjure great clouds of these insects and unleashing them against the foe.",

Feculent Gnarlmaws shiver at his passing, and when the Grand Cultivator is sent into the Mortal Realms, they burst through the veil of worlds with irrepressible eagerness. Such is Slimux’s skill in coaxing forth diseased foliage that he can bid the plants tunnel their roots through solid stone and steel, spreading the Garden of Nurgle with each emergence of foul life.",

Legend tells that such has been the case since he was buried beneath an avalanche of the daemonic imps whilst attempting to scale an unconquerable mountain. Trapped, Morbidex was confronted with endless inane riddles by the Nurglings. For each he failed to answer to their liking, he was further transformed to resemble the daemons. He continues to command the fascination of daemons, though he has long since ceased to wonder why this might be so, for his mind has rotted to giggling insanity. Wherever he rides, a repugnant carnival of disease follows as Nurgle’s diabolical scions caper and cavort in an effort to draw his attention.",

They are formed from the soul-stuff of mortals slain by Nurgle’s Rot, a daemonic contagion that attacks both body and spirit and combines elements of all the worst diseases known to mortalkind. It is nigh-on incurable and offers a terribly drawn out demise. Indeed, the afflicted perish only after embracing the full misery of their condition, their despairing souls being transported to Nurgle’s Garden and remade as shambling lesser daemons.\n\nPlaguebearers are moribund and curmudgeonly. They consider being sent into the realms to be a terrible imposition and find the antics of their more jovial counterparts gruelling in the extreme. Yet Plaguebearers fulfil a vital role in Nurgle’s eyes. They are his tallymen, charged with numbering the diseases that spread across the realms, the clangs of dolorous tocsins and the daemon mites that caper amidst the filth. The only sound that can muffle their counting is the drone of the fat-bodied flies that accompany them, forming so thick a cloud that enemies have difficulty taking aim at the daemons from afar. The rot-eaten bodies of the Plaguebearers are no easier to harm up close, while their pus-dripping blades can sap strength from even the most vigorous of warriors.",

This Great Unclean One hears every plea of mortals stricken by drought, every wail begging for life-giving rains – but these supplicants soon regret their careless entreaties. Nurgle’s Deluge, as the rains so generously conjured by Rotigus are known, spreads corruption at a terrible pace. Under its touch crops mutate, vegetation is reduced to festering mulch and mortals bloat with weeping, blistering pustules before bursting in gory showers. Those who survive the coming of the Deluge do so through embracing the munificence of the Rainfather and spreading his cult to lands further afield.\n\nRotigus is a masterful sorcerer, channelling putrescent magic through the downpours he summons. His spells inspire a most pustulant fecundity across lands watered by the Deluge, much as a farmer lavishes attention on their fields. Entire orchards of the Garden of Nurgle, and copses of daemonic trees set to sprouting across the realms, have known his life-giving touch, but the Rainfather believes that his work is never done. If there is one thing Rotigus cannot abide, it is the breaking of Nurgle’s gruesome cycles, and so he hates the undead with special vehemence, desiring to wash away their dust-dry kingdoms in a tide of filth.",

This scribbling is interrupted only by nasal browbeatings or sneezes that spray forth showers of vile slime. Some lunatic fancy of Nurgle saw him craft the Spoilpox Scriveners with a pervasive allergy to the stuff of reality, ensuring that their mood is constantly foul and spiteful.\n\nScriveners are not the most martial of daemons, but they are still figures of despised dread to their Plaguebearer underlings. Nurgle’s tallymen stand firm and fight all the more determinedly under the gaze of these Heralds, else they risk being marked for forcible transformation into the lunatic, hideously cheerful Heralds known as Sloppity Bilepipers. The irony is that the Scriveners are often commanded to work in tandem with the Bilepipers, together motivating the Plague Legions through a mixture of threat and obnoxious whimsy. The grating antics of Nurgle’s jesters ensure that Scriveners are forever on the edge of murderous apoplexy, glad of any opportunity to let their tentacled jaws snap at enemies in a fury.",

Though the Glottkin may fall on rare occasions, Nurgle can never remain irate with such cherished scions for long. In time, they always return, ready to spread filth and foulness anew.\n\nOtto Glott is the eldest by precisely seven seconds, a fact he mentions often. Jovial and gregarious, he is a masterful warrior despite his bulk. Ethrac, the middle sibling, is quite the opposite in temperament; an embittered soul who loudly criticises the decisions of his brothers and underlings, he is tolerated for his immense skill at plague-sorcery. The last and most physically imposing of the trio is Ghurk Glott. Once fair and meek, Nurgle has transformed him into a slow-witted leviathan upon whose shoulders his bickering siblings ride. Ghurk is capable of building terrible momentum on the charge, smashing open fortress gates or trampling all those in his path.",
