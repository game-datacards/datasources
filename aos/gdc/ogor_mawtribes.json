They are concerned only with the largest and flashiest kills, ranging ahead on the mawpath to slay the best of the beasts and take the choicest cuts of meat before the rest of the tribe can get there.\n\nA Bloodpelt Hunter will sometimes keep parts of their kills to wear as trophies or to use as tools. The roughly cut-off heads of drakes and megadons are worn around the waist and stuffed with the barbed bolts fired by their ballista-sized crossbows. The pelt of a cave bear forms a hardy cape to be drawn against the hostile elements. The antlers of great elk are strapped to the head to convince myopic prey, when downwind, that the approaching shape is a herbivore rather than a grisly, ravenous omnivore who stalks them with a killer’s eye. In battle, these glory hogs will go after the choicest targets, bloodily slaying enemy heroes and warbeasts to the disappointed groans of their kin in the main battleline who had hoped to make the big kill for themselves.",

It will come as no surprise, then, that their powers are summoned through the act of eating things.\n\nEach of the Butchers’ recipes hinges around the consumption of something with a potent spiritual component, using a resonant magic to impart the strength of the thing being devoured to themselves or those around them. Such materials range from strings of troggoth intestines filled with vitriolic bile to iron-hard rocks that must be eaten whole. So hastily are these ingredients scoffed down that they can cause internal damage, not only because of the sheer mass or density of the feast but also because of the magical energies unleashed. The gruel of blood and magic that roils in the Butcher’s throat heals more often than it hurts, though, the ever-hungry shaman growing strong on their invocations as their wounds close up with a ruddy sheen of health.",

As he gulped it down, he felt its white-hot flames course through him and unleashed a great belch of molten fire. The Firebellies insist that this event birthed the lava rivers of Aqshy or, indeed, the Realm of Fire itself. Most ogors have brains enough not to argue with them for long, as being turned into a smouldering pile of ashes is bad for one’s health.\n\nA Firebelly makes it their business to eat the spiciest and most flammable of foodstuffs to kindle their volatile gut in order to channel the Sun-eater’s fury. They will walk through fire and devour molten slop to such an end, pushing through the resulting pain. In war, Firebellies are able to breathe great plumes of flame and manifest mantles of burning magic that scorch the flesh from foes. To witness a furious Firebelly in all of their splendour is to witness a true child of the inferno – and usually to burn to death soon afterwards.",

Any Frostlord worth their salt will have conquered a massive, hairy beast of the mountains with which to lead the charge. They have a natural affinity with Stonehorns and Thundertusks – both breeds so powerful they can stamp an ogor into the ground.\n\nThe Thundertusk is a true force of destruction. Its enormous, jutting tusks, already formidable even before plates of spiked metal are bolted to their edges, are strong enough to batter apart a cogfort. The beast’s signature attack, however, is the spherical blast of ice it spits from its gullet, a boulder-sized projectile that can freeze enemy warriors solid in an instant. This is highly gratifying for the ogors; not only is each blast a decisive blow against the foe, but it also leaves their cadavers frozen and ready to be retrieved at leisure.",

Thus, the Gnoblars ‘give ’em back’ in the most violent way they can by launching them at high speed towards the enemy. It is not only weapons that are fired from a Scraplauncher but also shields, horseshoes, cutlery, jars of poison, bits of armour and even the odd captive. The entire mass is flung high into the air before dropping down amongst the enemy to impale, sever and score the odd kill.\n\nAt first glance, the horde of Gnoblars that ride these Scraplaunchers are a rowdy mob of pint-sized idiots wielding broken bottles, blunted hatchets and the odd sharpened implement.

On their own merit, a Gnoblar is unlikely to survive for long. By entering a loose symbiotic relationship with an ogor, they at least have a fearsome creature to hide behind. Moreover, an ogor tribe generates a colossal amount of waste: weapons too small to use, pieces of torn armour, and sometimes even treasure. There’s nothing a Gnoblar likes more than a bit of looting, as all too often the ogors pass over something of genuine worth in their haste to eat the flesh of the fallen.\n\nLong ago, after an era of war at the hands of the orruk warclans, the Gnoblars allied with the ogor race – as long as the Gnoblars did all their dirty work for them, the ogors promised not to eat them unless they were really hungry. It was a one-sided bargain, for the Gnoblars work tirelessly yet still get thrown around and stuffed in the cookpot.

When the Everwinter rages, Huskards pray to its arctic sentience, channelling an aspect of the Gulping God’s power. The roaring of the blizzard then intensifies, surrounding the chanter with a swirling white aura. Creatures of the Everwinter lope to join them, a fell light glowing in their eyes. The wind drives the Huskard’s beasts on and lends them a fierce primal strength. Even the storm joins in the violence, head-sized chunks of ice raining down to hammer and pulverise those who earn the Huskard’s wrath.\n\nThe Thundertusk is a true force of destruction. Its enormous, jutting tusks, already formidable even before plates of spiked metal are bolted to their edges, are strong enough to batter apart a cogfort. The beast’s signature attack, however, is the spherical blast of ice it spits from its gullet, a boulder-sized projectile that can freeze enemy warriors solid in an instant. This is highly gratifying for the ogors; not only is each blast a decisive blow against the foe, but it also leaves their cadavers frozen and ready to be retrieved at leisure.",

To them, extreme cold is no more impediment than a light summer rain. Some Hunters even revel in drinking the blood of Yhetees and Frost Sabres in order to exhale bone-chilling clouds of icy mist that leave thinling enemies paralysed and helpless before the blows of their clubs.\n\nIcebrow Hunters make excellent trackers, leading their tribe to fertile hunting grounds in the most remote of places. Having such a huntsman as part of the tribe can be the difference between life and death, for ogors are always ravenous, and one who can guide them to a supply of fresh meat is worth their weight in realmstone. Though they are formidable warriors, the Hunters do not fight as part of the greater mawtribe but instead tend to operate alone and at range. They gravely wound their prey with hurled spears and metre-long crossbow bolts before swiftly closing the distance to deliver the killing blow.",

Ogor legend has it that an ancient mawtribe climbed up to the Torc from the swampy lands below and declared war on the gargants they found there. The cannons of the Sky-Titans roared their wrath, their owners wading in with blade and fist, but in the end, it was not enough.

The gunners who crew these outrageous weapons are usually deaf, and so they watch like a hawk for their moment to discharge their prized artillery. Any who decide to attack the cannon before it can be reloaded are charged in turn by a badtempered rhinox and a roaring, indignant ogor.",

The gut-plates they wear tend to be more ornate than those of the Gluttons, and it is common practice for Ironguts to strap shields and bucklers taken from their downed foes to their torsos. These trophies are a welcome sign to their allies should a battle be going badly – for when the Ironguts smash into the press of battle, they can turn the tide of a fight all by themselves.",

Though he currently wages a protracted war in the Realm of Life, Kragnos can still be drawn to battle by the most ferocious fighting, his arrival announced by the smashing of enemy lines and the crushing of foes under his thunderous hooves.\n\nAlready a natural disaster made manifest, Kragnos’s rampages are further augmented by his legendary armaments. The shield Tuskbreaker is said to have been cast aside by Gorkamorka himself, deity of the orruks and other brutish beings. The spells of enemy mages break instantly upon its surface, supposedly due to the residual divine essence that suffuses it. The Dread Mace, Kragnos’s massive studded club, is powerful enough to shatter walls of solid rock. Legends say that Kragnos retrieved the weapon’s head from an ancient geomantic nexus, and that it is infused with Ghur’s own destructive animus.",

Gnoblars were likely involved in teaching the finer points, or perhaps a leap of destructive genius was gifted to them by the Gulping God. Whatever the reason, a certain breed of ogor soon became besotted with the sheer carnage they could cause with their new toys, and they came to be known as Leadbelchers.\n\nWhenever a town or settlement is sacked, Leadbelchers hog as much blackpowder as they can. Finding actual cannonballs proves a lot harder, for handguns are a lot more common than artillery in the armies of men and even duardin. To make up for this, Leadbelchers stuff discarded weapons into the barrels of their cannons – when the blackpowder detonates, these are fired with terrific force into the ranks of the foe, often causing even more damage than a cannonball by shredding a wide spread of victims. Better yet, once the powder has run dry and the ogors have closed in, those cast-iron cannons make for excellent clubs…",

Long, leathery tongues flick back and forth, tasting the air or whipping out to ensnare a passing morsel.\n\nMawpits are omnivorous in the extreme and can grind up any material, be it flesh, bone, wood or metal. Yet such is their appetite that they soon devour everything within reach, at which point they begin to screech and howl like starving dogs – an unnatural sound unlikely to ever be forgotten by those who hear it. Mawpits require a never-ending tribute of fresh meat, and if they do not receive it, they will eventually return to the stone and mud from which they emerged. It is for this reason that ogors strive to ensure that the Mawpits are hurled lavish amounts of newly slain victims on a regular basis.",

Mournfangs are hardy creatures capable of surviving weeks without food, and only the most grievous wounds will put a stop to their rampages.\n\nTypically, Mournfangs will only accept a rider after they have been pummelled over the head for long enough to accept dominance. However, to ensure they ride only the fiercest and most capable of these beasts, the ogors favour taking or breeding whelps, putting the litter into a fighting pit and waiting to see which rise to the top of the food chain. This harsh upbringing sees adult Mournfangs fight with a tenacious ferocity, goring chunks out of foes even as their riders hack down rival cavalry or those who seek to pierce the creatures’ thick, shaggy flanks – a significant challenge in itself.",

They ensure the enemy is knocked reeling even before they bring their clubs, fists and heads to bear. The ever-useful gut-plate plays a big part in this, for with the weight of the ogor concentrated behind a stout metal disc, the effect of a charging Glutton is much like that of a rampaging bull. Even if they are charging a spear-wall, they will still barge forward without hesitation; an ogor’s skin, fat, muscle and bone is so dense that most polearms will break in two rather than impale them.\n\nWhen Gluttons hit home, their foes are crushed bodily into the ranks of their fellows. The ogors capitalise on their crashing charge, staving in ribcages with their clubs and hacking clean through limbs with their oversized, rust-pitted blades. Should any be left standing, the Gluttons will lunge forward to crush enemy skulls with one almighty head-shattering bite.",

The beast’s signature attack, however, is the spherical blast of ice it spits from its gullet, a boulder-sized projectile that can freeze enemy warriors solid in an instant. This is highly gratifying for the ogors; not only is each blast a decisive blow against the foe, but it also leaves their cadavers frozen and ready to be retrieved at leisure.\n\nThe ice magic that runs in a Thundertusk’s veins gives it an aura of cold that will numb anything without a robust constitution merely through proximity – enemies fumble their swords from frostbitten fingers even as their breath catches ice-cold in their lungs. Sitting astride one is well worth the cold-deadened buttocks that follow, for the creature gives its rider – or riders, if more than one dares the climb – a great vantage point from which to pick their next kill. Better yet, with its flanks so cold, the creature can be strapped with stowage to keep raw meat and choice cuts frozen for as long as needed.",

Every one of them relishes the act of beating those who challenge them and eating the remains; no ogor stays on the top of the gigantic, fleshy heap for long without committing egregious amounts of physical harm. Sometimes they just roar, compelling those around them to do their bidding with bellowed threats and blasting them with foul-smelling breath. In battle, a Tyrant holds the line with their meaty, grasping arms as much as with any kind of tactical ability.\n\nThe weapons used by Tyrants are usually as heavy as their owners. The thundermace is a great example: a giant black-iron tenderiser so imbued with the earthy magic of the ogors that it can send tremors through the ranks of the foe. There is also the long, stout polearm called a beastskewer glaive, often nicknamed a ‘Big Spike’. This giant spear is capable of slashing open the guts of a Ghurish monstrosity; often a Tyrant will rush under a lumbering behemoth and slice it open along its length before feasting on the drizzling innards and offal that falls into their waiting mouth.",
