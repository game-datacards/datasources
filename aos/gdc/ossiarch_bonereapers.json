To him, even the most cultured aelven lord is nothing more than a contemptuous barbarian seeking to sully the deathly perfection of Shyish. Riding at the head of the Ossiarch’s elite cavalry formations, Zandtos seeks to annihilate all those who bear the taint of mortality, banishing their presence from his beloved realm for good. Such is his zealotry on this subject that even Katakros has on occasion had cause to censure the Arch-Kavalos for indulging his ruthless aggression. Yet the Mortarch of the Necropolis never keeps Zandtos leashed for long, because his mastery of cavalry warfare is a weapon too valuable to be cast aside.\n\nWielding the fabled Dark Lance itself – both a murderous weapon and an exalted staff of office – Arch-Kavalos Zandtos charges into battle eagerly, plunging his weapon through the flesh of his foes while his warsteed stomps and kicks furiously. His hatred of mortalkind is so intense that it affects nearby Kavalos riders, stirring the smouldering embers of their souls into a battle-fury that sees them recklessly hurtle into combat in pursuit of victory.",

Indeed, a Gothizzar Harvester’s passage across the lands can be tracked by the grim trail of flesh, gristle and empty armour left in its wake.\n\nEven in the thick of battle, the Harvester’s duties continue, as it amasses a gruesome stockpile that can be used to repair a legion’s casualties on the field. Despite their value as force multipliers, Ossiarch commanders typically use Harvesters to smash openings in the enemy’s formation, bludgeoning and hacking their way through a mass of bodies. As they trample forwards, distress soon turns to blind terror and precipitates panicked retreats – even bold warriors can be forgiven for fleeing as they watch their comrades being slaughtered, picked apart and processed before their very eyes.",

The Immortis Guard continue that storied legacy. Their own shields are a literal extension of their skeletal frames, used to drive the enemy back and clear space for the disembowelling slash of a dread halberd.\n\nThough they do not get to choose whom they protect, the Immortis Guard go about their duty with the utmost dedication. It is claimed that they have never routed, and Katakros himself rarely takes to the field without a contingent at his side. More so than any other class of Ossiarchs, the Immortis Guard view their cohorts as single entities and each warrior as merely an element of the whole. They speak in an eerie, emotionless unity and coordinate their defences through a faint telepathic bond. It is said that the only time an Immortis Guard experiences a flicker of sentiment is when one of their brethren is irrevocably felled in the line of duty. Any dismay, however, is soon buried beneath the imperative to unleash a punishing counter-attack.",

Their mounts are fashioned for speed and ferocity above all, powered by animalistic essences and the rendered-down souls of Bonereapers who have failed in their duties – and who remain eminently aware of their new equine status. Arrows, blades and arcane projectiles ricochet off these creatures, their charge not slowing a jot. When a Deathrider echelon slams home, it is akin to being hit by an avalanche, and their nadirite weapons – as well as the fangs and sharpened tails of their steeds – ensure that the Kavaloi rarely leave survivors in their wake.\n\nThough they take great pride in their martial skill, the Kavaloi riders are as disciplined on the battlefield as any other Bonereapers, befitting their status as warriors of the elite Priad warrior caste. They avoid the wild, glory-seeking charges that are so often the undoing of mortal or even immortal cavaliers; instead, the Deathriders’ Hekatos leaders form their troops into tight and precise wedges to plunge into enemy formations. Once the foe’s cohesion is shattered, the Deathriders will bid their steeds wheel away with an eerie synchrony or else ride on through terrain no normal horse would dare.",

Their strikes are clinical and efficient, whether delivered with nadirite spears and swords or with the greatblades favoured by those Morteks fashioned from the mutilated souls of berserkers and weaponmasters.\n\nDiscipline is the watchword of the Mortek Guard, the fulcrum upon which their successes turn. They cannot be bribed, induced to panic or burdened by despair; if they feel anything, it is only satisfaction at demonstrating the Bonereapers’ battlefield mastery. Whether they fight upon desert sands or beneath the canopies of flesh-eating trees, the Mortek Guard endure the harshest conditions without comment. Corpses pile around their feet as they kill with machine-like efficiency, preferring to preserve the bones of their victims whenever possible so that their final tally might contribute to the endless tithe.",

Cruel and tyrannical, the overlord of Shyish intends to conquer the Mortal Realms and transform them into a lifeless Necrotopia, in which not a speck of dust moves unless it is by his will. Wielding Alakanash, the Staff of Power, the cursed blade Zefet-nebtar, and surrounded by the Nine Books of Nagash, the Great Necromancer commands the full, terrible power of Shyishan magic. With a contemptuous gesture, he tears the souls from the living, their last moments of agonising horror providing the fuel for his next arcane onslaught.\n\nTo the Ossiarchs, Nagash is a creator god of dark majesty, the being that will bring about a true golden age for undead across the Mortal Realms. In his presence, they fight all the harder, inspired by a sense of devotion that is no less intense than any mortal’s religious fervour. When combined with the martial excellence of the Ossiarch legions, Nagash’s magic can unmake any foe, leaving the lands littered with corpses. These precious resources are soon gathered and stripped of their soft and vulnerable flesh, refined into osseous fuel for further conquests.",

They are also surprisingly swift despite their size, capable of closing the distance with their prey in just a few loping strides. Yet by far their most infamous feature is their four-faced quadrarch masks. These are designed to do more than merely unnerve; into each identical visage is bound the soul of a legendary warrior from across the realms, each of whom favoured a particular martial form.\n\nThe Mortisans have further sharpened the specialist talents of Necropolis Stalkers by stripping away even more of the souls’ distracting individuality than is typical, rendering them akin to machines. In battle, a Necropolis Stalker can bring one of these spirit fragments and their respective skills to the forefront of their consciousness, signified by their mask rotating until a new head faces forwards. As a result, Stalkers are supremely adaptive killers, equally capable against hordes of lesser enemies and coteries of armoured elites.",

In fact, these are not creatures of flesh and blood but necromantic creations known as Soulstealer Carrion. Each linked to the essence of an Ossiarch mage, these conjurations are sent into the skies to act as spies, scouts and sentries. The summoner of the endless spell can see through the avian entity’s eyes, ensuring that an Ossiarch legion is rarely taken unawares by an outflanking army.\n\nThough beholden to the will of their summoner, a Soulstealer Carrion possesses a strange form of sentience that ensures that it remains useful even after the enemy has been sighted. Freed from direct control, it dives and swoops above the heads of the Ossiarchs’ foes, radiating such a baleful aura of doom that even the bravest souls find their resolve to fight ebbing away, replaced with a sense of existential dread.",

The Ossiarch constructs of the Teratic Cohort were plucked from the ranks of the legions after failing in their duty, their forms broken down and remoulded into bestial shapes befitting the pariahs of Ossiarch society. Denied the glory of martial victory, they now perform only the most brutish and honourless tasks: conquering monster-ridden forests, hunting down troublesome raiders and seeking out valuable troves of osseous matter. Their existing soultrap gems set in new beast-bone forms, they are more aggressive and unpredictable than other Ossiarchs.\n\nEach Cohort detachment is led by a Kavalos Centari, a hulking centauroid creature usually formed from the upper half of a condemned Liege-Kavalos and the lower half of their former steed. Embittered and shamed by their new duties, they must nevertheless lead a motley retinue of Teratic warriors to victory in Nagash’s name. Aviarch Harpies and canine Teratic Prowlers are vicious hunting beasts made from the soulstuff of defective Ossiarchs, and one-eyed Mortek Cykloptians function as autonomous conduits through which their masters can peer upon lands their mighty armies would find it impossible to traverse.",
