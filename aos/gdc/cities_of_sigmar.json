      "fluff": "The specialist wizards known as Alchemite Warforgers can exaggerate the innate strength of metal exponentially. These members of the Gold College are often requested by the Freeguilds for their mastery over metals and arcane machinery, which proves to be more practical than the high arcane arts of other wizards. Through their magic, the resilience of the metal used by the God-King’s armies is multiplied many times over. Wrought iron becomes hard as duardin-worked gromril and shields become inviolable bulwarks. Meanwhile, enemies find their own armour transmuting into cumbersome lead, staggering them at the critical moment. Blade hilts suddenly burn white-hot, forcing their owners to drop them, whilst halberds find their biting edge drizzling away into molten slurry.\n\nThe signature artefact of the Alchemite Warforger’s profession is the massive crucible they bear at their side, a portable forge that contains the power of an inferno. Thick layers of leather protect them from the heat, but even veteran Alchemites must use long-handled tongs to bring out the runic cubes within. They use these cubes as lodestones that affect magical motes and the flow of the aether – simply by turning them this way and that, the Alchemite can melt metal around them until it flows at their command.",

These are true masters of the killer’s art, able to shroud themselves in gloom so as not to be seen by the naked eye. They believe there is a noble purity in taking a single life to save the lives of many – no matter the method required.\n\nActing as scouts and skirmishers in times of battle, Assassins far prefer to act as independents. If a sorcerous black mark in the shape of a curved blade appears on a person’s flesh, that unfortunate soul has been marked for death. To take flight is futile, and attempts to resist merely prolong the inevitable. There is no fortress, city or fortified war camp that the feared Shadowblade Assassins cannot infiltrate, and few foes can hope to survive the potent deathshead poison delivered by their wicked daggers. Stalking the shadows, the Assassin only reveals their position when they launch a killing strike. Once their target is in their sights, the Assassin seemingly bursts from pure darkness to unleash a flurry of attacks upon their unsuspecting victim.",

Whether through lineage traced to an ancient magocracy, natural affinity or the fruits of long study, each Battlemage has passed trials beyond number. They can slay a foe with a shouted phrase and a killing gesture just as easily as they can provide salvation with a warding symbol or chant. Amongst the Collegiate Arcane’s members are quick-tempered pyromancers from the Bright College and druid-like mages from the Jade College with the power of life at their fingertips. Morbid devotees from the Amethyst traditions of Shyish wield the chill magic of the grave, while those of the Gold College specialise in transmutation.\n\nThe wizard-philosophers of the White College use brilliant devices set with aetherquartz when they need to bolster the illuminations and ritual exorcisms they use to banish the foe. Known as Luminarks of Hysh, these obsessively calibrated contraptions concentrate motes of Hyshian magic through a series of arcane lenses. In doing so, they form a beam of light so intense that it can melt right through a rampaging daemon lord and leave a smoking hole behind. Powerful White Battlemages direct searing rays of light from the Luminark to vaporise enemy champions whilst deftly casting scouring sorceries of their own.",

Rather than fight a thankless war against these beasts, the masters of the Scourge fleets learn to avoid or even harness them using a combination of enchantment, patience and aelven artifice.\n\nThe Fleetmasters are known not only for the speed of their assaults but also for their flair. As happy to inveigle themselves into high society as they are to stoop to the gutter, they cut quite a dash in their frill-collared drakeskin cloaks. Any would-be rivals who underestimate them are soon corrected by force; the dexterity with which Fleetmasters wield the blade is quite incredible. Though nominally a part of the God-King’s great alliance, all such lords crave power unto themselves.

Dreadspears attack with pinpoint certainty, each warrior having been trained to wait for the perfect moment before thrusting their weapons into the hearts of their foes.\n\nThose Dawnbringers who have seen the Dreadspears in combat have remarked on the almost mechanical unison of their movements, how they march forth fearlessly into situations so dire that other warriors might have fled rather than face them. Indeed, Dreadspears are often sent to take the most dangerous of sites or to recover relics desired by their Sorceress. Precious few know the truth – that behind each Dreadspear’s glazed eyes is an arcanely imbued loyalty that compels them to carry out their Sorceress’s will at any cost. It is up to these silent warriors to fulfil those tasks their mistress does not trust humans to perform, for only in mind-controlled servants can she ensure absolute fealty.",

Standing by their commander are the Arch‑Knights, exemplars of the blade and axe who protect their lord in battle. Each bears a fierce totem fashioned after a great beast that reflects their fighting style. Next is a Great Herald, who holds aloft the regimental banner that will be planted at the heart of a new settlement. It is their role to sound the advance, charge and timely retreat.\n\nMost Command Corps include a War Surgeon skilled in the arts of triage and amputation. They are incredibly proficient, able to perform medical miracles even under fire on the battlefield. Should a soldier succumb to their injuries, however, their soul is guided to their afterlife by the Soul Shepherds, allowing them to escape the clutches of Nagash. The strange piping of the Shepherds’ homunculi is silent to the living, but a lilting requiem can be heard as one approaches death.\n\nLurking in the shadows are the Whisperblades, who keep the Marshal apprised of dissent. They wear cloaks of Ulguan falsecloth that allow them to blend with darkness – all the better to listen, learn and assassinate.",

Magic-wielding champions are silenced with a sphere of pure realmstone, taken with silver tongs from a small nullstone casket. In this way, even the meanest human gunline can take down the most vicious scourges of the Mortal Realms.\n\nThe weapons of these gunlines are loaded and fired in much the same way as a miniature cannon. Each is also set with a thick wooden shield, which, when facing outwards alongside the iron-rimmed shields of footsoldiers, creates a defensive Castelite formation. The slaughter-fusils used by some Fusil-Sergeants, however, are more complex. These devastating firearms are triple-barrelled and able to be fired in quick succession or in one blistering volley. Such weapons are cumbersome, especially when carried in conjunction with hardwood pavises and lanterns for reloading in darkness; yet, in a flurry of movement, the gun is prepped, propped and raised.

After all, Steelhelms are most frequently the humble men and women of the Sigmarite cities, recruited from all walks of life. This is not to say that they are untrained – once they take the Coin, the recruits are given arms and armour and drilled in their city’s military academy for the expedition to come.\n\nEach battalion is headed by a Steelhelm Herald, bearer of the consecrated regimental standard. The toughest, most resolute member of the soldiery is usually given this duty – so vaunted is this honour that they would rather die than let the standard fall. Alongside them comes the Battle Priest. Ever ready to deliver a sermon or beat back the God-King’s foes with their fists and hammers, they carry the relic of a Sigmarite martyr to clear Chaos taint from their path. If a Battle Priest forms the spiritual armour of the Steelhelms, it is the Sergeant-at-Arms who provides its iron fist. Resolute, stubborn and formidable, they use wits as well as brawn to ensure they and their unit live to fight another day.",

When the enemy closes in, the ogor below uses their giant tower shield and heavy-headed mace to crush those foolish enough to get within reach.

Even city ogors, known for their ability to overrule the grumbling of their stomachs for hours at a time, are unpredictable. No ogor likes being clambered over by a mere thinling who should really be inside their gut. Those teams that last tend to have some manner of connection – a life debt after the gunner had saved the ogor from certain death, for instance, or a lost bet that the ogor feels obligated to fulfil.",

      "fluff": "When a long reach is needed, the duardin will employ flying rotorcraft known as Gyrocopters. These can act as excellent scouting assets and messengers at need, especially in mountainous cities such as Tempest’s Eye. Small and nimble single‑duardin fighter craft, Gyrocopters roar over the heads of their targets in tight formation, strafing them with fire or scalding steam before wheeling away to begin another attack run. Their resilient metal shells deflect all but the most destructive of return fire, allowing them to circle directly above their foes and rain down devastation from above.\n\nThese war machines truly shine at range. Each one is equipped with a gun best suited for the battle ahead: either a flamethrowing brimstone gun to melt through armour as easily as butter or a boiling-hot steam gun to cook through enemy rank and file. Each Gyrocopter also carries a single payload of guild bombs. These blackpowder explosives are fantastically powerful, their detonations visible even from the horizon. Being able to operate all these weapons whilst piloting such a device is considered an honoured craft amongst the duardin, and many families pass down the skills needed to do so through their ancestral line.",

When the Hammerers’ carnyx sounds the charge and the gleam of their gilded, sloped helmets can be seen cresting the horizon, surrounding allies are inspired to fight ever harder. The duardin are particularly beloved of the Warden King whom they serve; even away from the battlefield, they are his trusted advisors and drinking companions.",

      "fluff": "Duardin are suspicious folk who eschew magic wherever possible, for they consider it to be a fickle and dangerous art. Their hardy culture is instead rooted in martial tradition and prayer to their ancestors. What little magic they do use is concentrated within runes – inscribed sigils of power – rather than being cast directly by a mage. Runelords are talented metalsmiths who have mastered the ancient art of rune-shaping. Through rituals of hammercraft, they can unbind hostile magic or imbue the weapons of their kin with fearsome killing power.\n\nEach Runelord carries a rune staff and a forgehammer. First, they will beat sigils of power into metal and rock surfaces with the forgehammer, drawing on practised knowledge passed down through generations. Then, each rune is imbued with magical power using the rune staff, allowing the aetheric energy to be stored indefinitely. By calling on the stored, latent power of their engravings, the Runelords can imbue the weapons of their kin with ancient might. They will also craft warding runes during battle, allowing them to dampen or unbind the castings of enemy mages.",

      "fluff": "Many sinister rumours surround the rulers of the Darkling Covens. Their presence in the free cities is obscured by both mental layers of trickery and a physical web of secret temples. Despite this, their sheer arcane prowess makes them an invaluable ally of Sigmar’s people. The Sorceresses of the Darkling Covens are largely reclusive figures, though they possess tremendous political influence and skill in the magical arts. No aelven offensive is launched in the service of Sigmar’s hosts without there being a substantial gain for these shadowy mistresses. They command absolute power over their covens in times of battle, for their Dreadspear phalanxes and Bleakswords obey them unquestioningly. The warriors’ grace is marked by a wordless focus – the only indication that their loyalty is more ensorcelled than genuine.\n\nMany Sorceresses go to war upon fearsome Black Dragons. They delight in the terror in the eyes of their enemies as the scaled beasts rip their prey apart with sword-sized talons. Meanwhile, from the drake’s elegant fanged maw, clouds of caustic, choking gas billow over the battlefield from on high to poison all below.",

First in her favour is the blade Parchtongue, white-hot with Aqshian magic that is cool to her touch alone, followed by the greataxe Justice. When fighting alongside the Cults Unberogen, she opts for the Hammer of Zeal. She hates the heavy mace named Warmaker with a passion and has ‘accidentally’ lost it a dozen times, though it somehow always finds its way back to her.\n\nVedra’s famous battle-temper is mirrored in her great leonine steed, the manticore Infernadine. Only those with formidable willpower and authority could ever hope to train a manticore; Vedra possesses both qualities in abundance, and the two make a terrifying pair indeed.",

Her unscrupulous talents nearly saw her executed, but Toll saw the crypt-breaker’s potential and recruited her, assuring her that if she served Sigmar faithfully, her previous crimes would be forgotten. Second of the agents is Mistress Verentia, who lurks like a spider at the centre of a web of intrigue. Her agents observe every corner of the Twin-Tailed City. Her ‘little watchers’ are not humans but urban beasts: crows, rats and cats that communicate their discoveries to their mistress via her enchanted glove. Finally comes Lord-Castellant Valius, who is responsible for Hammerhal’s internal security. He is the Keeper Aqshian and bears the Clavis Magna – a device that allows him to pass through any threshold in the city and emerge from any other.",
