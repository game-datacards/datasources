      "fluff": "The epithet of Bladebringer is offered to any Herald of Slaanesh who excels at high-speed chariot warfare. Yet in the glorious years of the Age of Chaos, the first of their kind were not slaughterers but messengers, charged to deliver enchanted blades to rulers who might be tempted into Slaanesh’s service. Alas, the Dark Prince’s artisans had infused temptation into the swords too well. The Bladebringers became consumed by a covetous desire for the gifts they carried; even as they handed over the swords, they nursed a deep-seated bitterness that blossomed into obsession. If they could not wield these weapons, they would compensate by affixing as many threshing wheel-blades as possible to their stately chariots. The havoc that the Bladebringers wreak as a result is immense, but it can never ease their deep longing for the swords they gave away.\n\nBladebringers ride atop imperious constructs known as Exalted Chariots, pulled by several hooting Steeds and pursued by throngs of lesser charioteers. Yet for all the murderous majesty of their war-conveyances, it has done little to allay their anger at surrendering their coveted weapons. Bladebringers vent their frustration on the most formidable enemies, directing their squadrons to crash into them at high speed and shred them to ribbons.",

Only then do the Daemonettes pause and perform their horrendous ministrations on the fallen – but never for long, as new and more tantalising opportunities for depravity soon draw their attention.\n\nTo mortal eyes, Daemonettes appear as the very image of temptation, promising an unimaginable degree of luxury and excess. They appear to the onlooker as whatever they most fervently desire, every detail designed to enrapture their senses and lower their guard. Only at the last moment does this glamour fall, and the horrific truth of the Daemonettes is revealed.

Battle is the apex of the sensations Dexcessa craves, every spray of blood and howl of the dying sweet beyond words. They cavort across the field as a rapturous cyclone of murder, bladed claws sending heads and limbs spiralling in stately arcs.\n\nTo watch Dexcessa at war is to witness an artist of the most brutal temperament: a painter who channels turmoil through canvas-lashing strokes, a sculptor who hacks stone into submission. It is a sight that enraptures fellow Hedonites, compelling them to fight with greater orgiastic abandon. Each hopes to catch the attention of Slaanesh’s Talon, but such is a futile endeavour. Dexcessa has no concern for anything but the indulgence of their own desires – that and the appallingly artistic ruin they leave in their wake.",

So enthralling was their manner that, as the heinous festivities of the night intensified, the assembled libertines lathered them with attention. Infuriated, the master of the palace determined to slay all his sycophantic guests. Rallying his guard, he returned to find the revellers fused into an eidolon of screaming flesh, crowned by the mask’s cruel visage. The Palace Grandiose soon collapsed, and none know where its ruins lie.\n\nWhatever the truth of this grim fable, the Dreadful Visage is redolent with horror. It is an entity conjured from the Realm of Chaos whose lash-like tongues flail from its mouth. Those struck by these tongues are wracked by visions of the most atrocious acts imaginable.

As unnatural creations, Fanes may be coaxed into reality upon a battlefield by supplicants, if they provide worthy tribute.

Sometimes, this takes the form of sacrifice and pain, the shrine vibrating faintly as spiced blood splatters to the earth. Yet every Fane of Slaanesh possesses an avaricious side and will accept gifts of trinkets, both magical and gilded, to satiate themselves. This has led many weaker souls to destruction; desperate to bathe in favour once more, they are compelled to steal and murder to acquire worthy offerings, until eventually their greed outpaces their ability.",

To those mortals not in Slaanesh’s favour, a Fiend’s song is nigh-on unbearable, rolling through the meat of their minds like a ball of wicked knives.

Upon breaking into the Temple of the Cornucopian Rite and devouring its sacred grains, he was cursed by the daemon Loth’shar, the patron of the temple’s cult. Loth’shar bade Glutos indulge the most appalling hungers to survive, culminating in eating the flesh of wizards – and, to the daemon’s delight, Orscollion soon developed a taste for depravity.

Cackling Daemonettes would ride Hellflayers to slice off fingers, toes and other appendages, all to a chorus of agonising screams.

Abandoning their duties, they joined one of Slaanesh’s Hedonite hosts and were delighted to discover that a Hellflayer was the perfect contraption for shattering tight enemy formations – both in body and spirit, since the diced remnants of comrades-in-arms fell as a gory rain upon the survivors.

This obsession soon becomes all-consuming. The artist grows to reject all kinship and self-preservation, crumbling beneath what they see as a divinely ordained endeavour. In the end, they give themselves to Slaanesh, desperate for the inspiration needed to become one with their craft. The Enrapturess acquiesces – by tearing the mortal apart in body and spirit, transforming them into a macabre living instrument that, when plucked, plays notes of purest torment.\n\nAs the legions of Slaanesh indulge their warlike excesses, the Enrapturesses serenade them with compositions of reality-shaking agony. These notes of discord can overpower even the stuff of sorcery, blunting the aether in a wave of spiritual pain.

Despite their flesh being pierced by cruel hooks and barbs, by Slaanesh’s dubious graces, a Lord of Pain remains a formidable physical specimen. In combat, they fight not to slay but to inflict the most torment possible, using their spiked maces and the sharpened curves of their armour to lacerate and puncture enemies by the score.\n\nThe hosts ruled by a Lord of Pain are amongst the most discomfiting to look upon of all Slaanesh’s worshippers. No violation of the flesh is forbidden amongst their ranks, as long as it elongates the sensation of pain. The fact that the Hedonites perform these mutilations on the canvas of their own bodies only renders the sight more horrific. The Lords of Pain stand at the apex of the torturer’s art, and their ability to endure hurt – whether in riotous worship or fighting at the most contested point of the battlefield – is awe-inspiring to their devotees.",

Pride and weakness compels the watcher to peer deeper, their desire a powerful intoxicant to nearby Hedonites. They cannot look away, even as the vision turns to one of mocking horror in which every ideal they possess is perverted.

There is an elegance to these conveyances as they glide across the earth at great pace, their regal daemon crew spared the indignity of having to walk, which contrasts most delightfully with the gore-spraying carnage that follows their impact with an enemy line, as whirring blades send mangled flesh and limbs flying. There are daemonic artisans who specialise in the construction of war engines known as Seeker Chariots. Though these lightweight devices appear fragile, they possess remarkable agility, and their spinning scythe-wheels can eviscerate an armoured warrior in moments. Pulled by Steeds of Slaanesh, a Seeker Chariot lets out a disharmonious wailing as it streaks across the battlefield, a cacophony that delights Slaanesh’s worshippers and torments all others.\n\nThose Daemonettes who ride a Seeker Chariot wield long and semi-sentient whips, the better to strike at enemies from the high vantage point of their conveyance. These daemons consider it great sport to tangle their whip round a foe’s neck, dragging their writhing body behind the chariot and dashing them against the ground – that is, until they grow bored of the diversion, whereupon they break their prey’s neck with the twitch of a wrist.",

Many Daemonettes covet a Steed to carry them to new debaucheries, but to catch one of these creatures is near impossible.

Many prey do not even see the lashing tongue or barbed claw that kills them. The Steeds of Slaanesh are tireless, allowing the Seekers to hunt their quarry over great distances. Often, the greatest difficulty for the Daemonette rider is not in giving chase to fleeing foes but rather in pulling their Steed’s attention away from the pursuit and rejoining the greater host.",

Though he appears clean-limbed and in the prime of health, Sigvald’s misdeeds pre-date the realms themselves: it is said that he was sired through unnatural acts and that he would put cities to the torch for offending him with their odour. It is undeniable that he is a bladesman par excellence, striking faster than the eye can follow and leaving a carpet of bisected dead with each lightning-fast flurry of the sword Shardslash. However, legend also claims that Sigvald once suffered a humiliating defeat and, as punishment, had his soul sealed in an enchanted mirror. Only through great cunning did he escape and return to the Dark Prince’s favour.\n\nSigvald is determined to reassert his status as the Dark Prince’s favoured champion. At his approach, a mirror-curse washes over the land; those who spy their reflection in glass see themselves as monstrously warped and deformed, for all beauty is reserved for the Geld-Prince alone. To offend Sigvald is to meet with death – though this most prideful of champions considers falling by his hand to be a singular honour.",

Slaangors do not burden themselves with selfdefence or anything that might distract them from wreaking havoc.

The Slaangors think nothing of it; indeed, outside of battle, they think of little at all, staggering through the Hedonite warcamps in a glassy-eyed stupor. This numbness fades only when prey is scented on the wind. Wise Slaaneshi champions know that the Slaangors cannot be commanded in any meaningful sense.

An Exalted Steed may remain in reality far longer than most daemons – but only if it is bound to its rider through strange and uncanny blood-mingling rites.

Syll selected Esske as the focus of her patronage, overseeing his meteoric rise. Esske, in turn, showed a loyalty well beyond expectation, going so far as to sacrifice his own soul to aid Syll after she was brought low by a jealous rival. Through the Herald’s latter deeds, he was not only saved but fused with her very being, the two becoming a single entity that fights in perfect synchronicity.\n\nThe Vengeful Allegiance marches at the head of a warhost comprising both mortals and daemons, all of whom have been spurned by their betters and seek symbiosis as a means of realising their depraved ambitions. Should Syll or Esske block a blow, their other half will take cruel advantage, striking with lash or greataxe to slip inside the foe’s guard. Having known well the scorn of the highhanded, Syll’Esske delights in subverting heroes and champions, undermining their will and replacing certainty with unclean desires.",

No daemon can claim a more profound connection to the Dark Prince – no daemon, that is, save Dexcessa, a fact that infuriates both twin-beings. Synessa is that aspect of Slaanesh that beguiles the senses and unmakes the will. They are the honeyed word, the lingering temptation, the promise of ever-sweeter indulgences. With deft oratory, Synessa can inspire foolhardy courage and induce crippling paranoia. Nothing pleases them more than twisting noble causes into unclean obsession, considering the greatest victories to be those that never require them to lift a claw.\n\nThis is not to say that Synessa is incapable of defending themselves. A flick of their enchanted staff can so completely twist a victim’s mind that they tear themselves apart in a paroxysm of misguided righteousness, while a single whisper can plant a seed of doubt that can hamstring an enemy at a critical moment. Still, this pavonine daemon far prefers to leave the uncouth business of battle to their brute sibling or their flocks of adoring worshippers; to be a voyeur witnessing bloody carnage is a thrill in itself.",

Yet where once Slaanesh had marvelled at their agility and grace, now he brooded upon imagined slights in every motion. In a spiteful rage, the Dark Prince banished the Masque, and laid a curse upon them: if they wished to dance, they would do so forever.\n\nThe Masque has continued their performance across the realms. They appear unbidden, often amongst the ranks of the enemy, for they are ever eager to find new audiences for their art. As the Masque enacts the tales of Slaanesh’s glories, their face flickers to match the characters they embody; their stance changes too, sometimes wild and aggressive, other times so graceful that it is all but impossible to land a blow upon them. Those whom the Masque does not slay with their eviscerating claws are nevertheless dragged into the performance, compelled to dance themselves to death as they try to keep pace with the daemon’s twirls and somersaults.",

Many such inventive devices can be found in the torment-boudoirs of the Palace of Pleasure, and the Wheels of Excruciation are magically crafted in their image. They spin across the battlefield at terrible speed, leaving shredded regiments in their wake.\n\nSome Slaaneshi sorcerers reserve the Wheels for foes whom they deem to be below their notice: massed mobs of grots, shrieking Clanrat swarms, the lowborn infantry of Sigmar’s cities. Tales are still told of the Laceration of Truth, one such spell-construct that hunted mendicant monk caravans across the deserts of Xintil at the behest of a Hedonite conjurer too indolent to pursue them herself. There are those devotees of the Dark Prince, however, who consider the pain-gift of the Wheels to be a mark of favour – indeed, these faithful summon smaller renditions of these spells to mortify their own flesh away from the battlefield.",

Rolls that have been replaced count as unmodified rolls and cannot be re-rolled. You cannot use temptation dice to replace a re-roll.\n\nEach time your opponent uses a **temptation dice**, they must roll it. On a 1-2, your opponent’s roll is replaced by that value instead of a 6, and you must allocate D3 damage points to the unit for which the roll was replaced immediately aer the ability used by that unit has been resolved (ward rolls cannot be made for those damage points).\n\nAt the end of the battle round, any **temptation dice** that have not been used are lost."
