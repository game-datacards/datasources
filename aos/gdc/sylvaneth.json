Yet these powers can just as soon be turned to war. At Alarielle’s command, her enemies are washed away in torrents of raging waters, strangled by thrashing ironoak roots, or transmuted to living wood. There is no mercy in the Everqueen’s heart; she has entered the season of her War Aspect and now blooms with a passion only vengeance can curb.\n\nAlarielle’s sorceries are able to summon flurries of healing pollen, as well as to mature new groves of Sylvaneth. In her right hand she wields the Spear of Kurnoth, a relic said to contain the dwindled essence of her consort and huntergod. Her left limb has been replaced by the Talon of the Dwindling, a sickle-like wooden claw that drains opponents of vitality. \n\nOne of the Everqueen’s most powerful allies is her mount, a hulking Wardroth Beetle. This titan’s horns can topple even fortress walls. When Alarielle takes wing, her Wardroth is capable of transforming into a swarm of pulsing glowspites to follow her and reform once more.",

The Branchwyches, however, are just as infamous for their tempers, for they are swift to anger when pressed – and the forests often reflect their anger, fed by their furious spirit.\n\nOnly the fey spites are immune to a Branchwych’s wrath, for these druidic Sylvaneth dote upon the strange little creatures. Many wondrous varieties of spite flutter around a Branchwych, but their closest companions are the bittergrubs – caterpillar-like entities that ride upon a Branchwych’s shoulder and savagely attack nearby foes. Once a bittergrub has fed sufficiently, it will metamorphosise into an emerald cocoon before splitting open to release a wave of shimmering, rejuvenating pollen across the tainted earth.",

However, centuries of woe have seen the song of the Dryads darken. The wailing notes of the Forest Folk – laments of loss and profound anger – leave the foe fearful and disoriented. These songs also call upon the lands that the Dryads tend so carefully, summoning thickets of tanglevines to ward off enemy blows.\n\nThough they will heed the wishes of a wargrove’s commander in the manner of the innately hierarchical Sylvaneth, Dryads are not soldiers – only killers. They are adept ambushers, slipping through dense wyldwoods to emerge where the foe least expects them. Then the Dryads begin their murderous work, talons lashing out with such fury that they can find purchase upon even the armour of Chaos.",

These skirmishers are infamous for their punishing accuracy and the hideous fate of those struck by their projectiles. Gossamid Archers are given the power of flight by the zephyrspites that clasp their torsos, magical creatures with powerful, buzzing double wings. Such is the bond between Sylvaneth and spite that, should a retreat need to be made, the zephyrspites will detach and fly at the enemy to buy time for their master.\n\nThough the Gossamids’ bows are supple and strong, it is their arrow shafts that hold the secret to their lethality. The quiverbug each keeps at their hip extrudes a special type of larval pod, its shape akin to an arrow. When fired into the flesh of an enemy, the ravenous grubs couched within the arrowhead hatch, eat and grow to maturity in seconds, usually resulting in a shocking explosion of gore. Once their gestation is complete, a buzzing whirlwind of new quiver-bugs will fly off, seeking out more Gossamids to recommence the cycle of life-through death.",

Fuelled by a desire to protect the legacy of their people, they will fly into the very jaws of death to this end. The rituals by which the Seekers extract the lamentiri from dead Sylvaneth fills nearby forest spirits with a portion of their kin’s final energies. This essence knits wounds back together and regrows lost limbs as a last gift from the fallen, imparted only to those who fight to ensure the continuation of their race.",

They embody the darkest of the natural cycles which sees them shunned even by their own kin, some of whom believe that their bitter malaise can spread. Many Spite-Revenants band together in exile and are collectively known as the Outcasts.\n\nSome say the Spite-Revenants were once spites who made grim bargains in an effort to become true Sylvaneth, or else are the product of a ritual of Alarielle’s that went hideously awry. When war calls, these twisted creatures creep forth from hidden groves, bodies glowing with eerie wisp-lights. Though their talons are sharp, the greatest weapon of the Spite-Revenants are their voices, for while they cannot harmonise with the spirit-song, they wail cacophonies of nerveshredding dissonance.",

Even as the world ended and that great tree was cast into the void, the dragonspites survived, trapped within mystical amber. When Alarielle sang the Rite of Life to restore the realms from corruption, this amber was sent running like wax and the dragonspites were freed, swollen through the magics they had absorbed. Alarielle’s song has become entwined with their souls, and only a single mighty blow can hope to overcome their regenerative capabilities – otherwise they will heal and endure, as endless as the seasons.",

The Tree-Revenants strive to embody the nobility of these mythical beings, from their selfless defence of Forest Folk tribes to their flowing fighting styles.\n\nMarshalling under fluttering silken banners, Tree-Revenants wield their enchanted glaives and blades with a skill to rival that of any aelven swordsman, and within their graceful forms lingers a potent reservoir of life energies. Yet despite their martial trappings, Tree-Revenants are not the sort to simply advance on a foe in disciplined lockstep. Using enchanted waypipes, they open paths through the realmroots, emerging from the depths of dense woodland to claim key reservoirs of magic or strike down unsuspecting enemies in a flurry of violence.",

They can call upon the spirits of the forest to aid them in times of need. With an earthshaking stomp, Treelords can also send nearby foes reeling, rendering them easy prey for smaller allies.\n\nTreelords possess an instinctive command of the spirit-song and are able to shape its notes to guide lesser Sylvaneth in accordance with the will of their glade’s rulers – and beyond that, the Everqueen herself. This innate skill leads to them developing a deep spiritual connection with the forests of the realms. Despite their great size, they are able to navigate strange and secret paths through the deepwoods and between sites of power, emerging seemingly from nowhere to assail a terrified enemy.",

Over time, their mastery over the eldritch energies of Ghyran grows, and the recklessness of youth cools to wise even-headedness. Thus do they become Treelord Ancients, the leaders of the clans, calling upon the experience of centuries – or even millennia – to chart a path forwards.\n\nAge weighs upon even these creatures, however. Some Treelord Ancients are irascible souls jaded by centuries of life and loss. Others may appear outright mad by mortal standards, either in the manner of a charismatic sage or an unpredictable natural disaster that has begun to splinter under the weight of years. In most cases, a Treelord Ancient’s eccentricities stem from them simply hearing the spirit-song on a keener level than most, allowing them to weave complex spells from the strands of life and cultivate new Wyldwoods into being in an instant. Even in battle, as they lead their kin and harness their magic in breathtaking displays of jade spellcraft, a Treelord Ancient keeps part of their mind clear and detached. In doing so, they carefully observe all around them, the better to share their knowledge with future generations.",

They channel it through an ornate flute set with a fragment of bark from the Oak of Ages Past. They possess an instinctive sense for the ley lines that cross the realms, following these arcane pathways and playing their song of rejuvenation so that they may coax the lands to healing. On their travels, they are surrounded by swarms of flittering spites and carpets of thrashing roots which viciously lash out at any who would impede them.\n\nThe song that these Revenants play is composed of pure arcane force. To the Sylvaneth, it is a stirring tune of great vibrancy, while to their allies it is a fey and unsettling earworm that never entirely fades from the edge of hearing. Beings corrupted by Chaos perceive the ballads of a Warsong Revenant as terrifying, soul-shredding dissonances that echo weirdly from the depths of the woods; those who hear it are left staggering and insensate, right up until they are beheaded by the Revenant’s arcanely charged falchion.",
