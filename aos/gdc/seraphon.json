Aggradons are no noble cavalry steeds but terrifying, rampaging killers that enter a frothing frenzy at the merest taste of blood. Eyes rolling over and drool spilling from their gore-slick jaws, they rip their prey to shreds, kicking out with powerful hind limbs tipped with sickle shaped talons.\n\nOnly the imperturbable saurus would ever dream of riding such a creature to war, and even amongst their ranks, only a few are capable of doing so. These rare beings are marked out by their distinctive crests, signifying them as the chosen spawn of Itzl, the master of beasts. Only they can approach an Aggradon without risk of evisceration and disembowelment, attaching harnesses and tail feathers to their chosen mount and daring to haul themselves onto its back. From that point on, rider and mount are inseparable, sharing the thrill of the hunt and the joyous slaughter of battle. While their raptor companion tears into the enemy, the crested saurus lashes out with celestite weapons, slaying those who evade the Aggradon’s raking claws.",

Following the tenets laid down by their namesake deity, they prefer to stalk their prey unseen – only striking when the enemy’s guard is lowered and they are at their most vulnerable. Ranged weapons are their favoured tools for this purpose, for they suit a chameleon skink’s slight frame and dexterous ability.\n\nPerhaps the most devastating of these are the starstone bolas. These weapons consist of a leather strap containing multiple moonstone orbs, each charged with Azyrite energy. When thrown, the bolas unleash a sizzling blast that burns and blackens the target’s flesh. As the enemy reels, scorched and half blinded, they are skewered by volleys of hunter javelins launched with perfect accuracy. The Hunters of Huanchi do not hesitate to charge in amongst their prey to deal a killing blow. They swing light maces and use their javelins, which have celestium points sharp enough to cut diamond, as short spears to finish off those who survived their initial barrage.",

When not called upon to fight, they are utilised as heavy labour for the ever-expanding Seraphon temple-cities, hauling gigantic blocks of stone or pieces of rare technology into place. Even then, they require the prompting of skink overseers, who possess a potent connection to their gigantic kin – almost as if the Old Ones purposefully created them to work in concert. Kroxigor obey their commands instinctively, seemingly calmed by the presence of the diminutive lizards. On the eve of battle, skink priests identify those Kroxigor marked by cosmic portents and present them with sacred vestments and enormous moonstone hammers, bolstering their terrible strength yet further.",

They much prefer to conduct matters with their weapons and, accordingly, have access to a wealth of esoteric armaments held in the vaults of the Old Ones.

Taller and broader than their kin, their rough scales are criss-crossed with scars and old wounds, and they radiate a primal authority that all other Seraphon, save for the slann, intuitively defer to. Though not scholars of war, their instincts have been honed by centuries of killing; as a result, an Oldblood innately understands when to strike or when to roar for his warriors to close ranks and form an impenetrable wall of fangs and claws.\n\nIn battle, Saurus Oldbloods are death incarnate. Wielding relic weapons taken from the vaults of the Old Ones and sat astride apex predators known as Carnosaurs, they plunge into enemy ranks, hacking and tearing in a terrifying display of primal power. To hear the blood-chilling roar of a Carnosaur is enough to fill the hardiest warriors with mindless fear – but perhaps the beast’s most infamous features are its rending jaws. It is said that once these frenzied creatures scent blood, their bite carries with it enough strength to rip the head clean off a gargant.",

When they are not called upon to fight, they spend most of their time performing the tasks that keep the temple-cities and ships functioning – acting as administrators, technicians and artisans.

When the stars pulse with flaring wrath, the spawning pools of the skinks steam and boil, and from within emerge the Sun Acolytes, marked out as Chotec’s favoured by their frills and fins.

These liquids ignite upon impact, erupting in great fireballs that melt armour and flesh with ease, transforming the victim into a screaming, blazing torch. Should the enemy close in to deliver a killing blow, the Spawn of Chotec will emit streams of searing flame before lumbering forwards to devour the charred remains of its unfortunate prey.",

The ground trembles beneath the terrific weight of these heavily armoured monsters as they charge into the midst of the enemy, crushing and goring in a deadly rampage. Meanwhile, its Chief screeches commands to their nearby warriors and warbeast handlers, directing them to surround and annihilate their enemies. This display of sheer might is enough to bolster the morale of any skink who witnesses it, encouraging them to continue fighting even when facing the most nightmarish of foes.\n\nAccompanying the Chief is a crew of well-armed skinks equipped with various bows, javelins and spears. Their duty is to both protect their master and prevent any foes from reaching the Stegadon. Skystreak bows that hurl celestite-tipped bolts can be found atop many howdahs, while sunfire throwers – celestial weapons that spew gouts of cosmic flame – incinerate in an instant those foolish enough to draw too close.",
