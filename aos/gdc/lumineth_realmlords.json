These are the animus of the realm’s majestic peaks come forth, bound into war-forms carved from realmstone-laced rock and wielding huge, crushing hammers. To petition one to march to battle, the Lumineth must spend weeks appealing to these entities, for the mountains loathe rash decision-making. Once their course is set, however, these aelementors are unbreakable allies. Their wisdom is always sage, and their hammers can cave in the skull of a gargant with a single swing. In their presence, the power of the earth itself is awakened, unleashed through devastating shock waves.\n\nThe war-forms of mountain spirits are themselves miniature ecosystems, their bodies garlanded by trees and their sunmetal armour cooled in the mountains’ own lakes and streams. Lesser animuses shelter in their mighty shadow. Their core, however, is their mask, which resembles the visage of an Ymetrican longhorn. Should the unthinkable happen and this mask be lost, then some part of the mountain’s soul may be lost with it. Still, Hysh’s peaks know that they must risk this grim fate to defend their earthly incarnations.",

These nature spirits once held a bitter disdain for the aelves after being damaged in the Ocari Dara. To walk their valleys was to risk death by avalanche, landslide or exposure. Only decades of repentance soothed the mountains’ jaded souls and, in time, compelled them to grant the most worthy aelves wisdom and strength.\n\nTo become a Stoneguard demands a singular will. Many are the tests an aspirant must endure, from fasting atop the highest peaks to running alongside roaring rockfalls. The climax of these trials is to be literally buried alive. If the aelf is judged to have heeded the mountains’ wisdom, they will find themselves able to breathe through tiny cracks in the rock and eventually rise as an Alarith.\n\nWhen the Stoneguard plant their feet and focus upon the teachings of their aelementor, the flesh of these warriors takes on the consistency of stone. Then the Alarith truly do become immovable objects, shrugging off even the most determined of blows. Hammers wrought from sedimentary rock and diamondcored mattocks are their favoured weapons.",

Something in this unshakeable purpose slowly placated the mountain spirits, and they granted the regretful aelves moss growths and scuttling creatures to feast on.\n\nOver time, these tenuous relationships became true understandings, and those Lumineth of a most mystical disposition were granted the secrets of geokinetic and lithomantic sorceries. Stonemages speak with the commanding rumble of the avalanche and can adjust gravity’s pull to send even heavy stones floating serenely into the air around them. In battle, such is the bond between Stonemage and aelementor that, when the mountain spirits march in their war-forms, these aelves are often found in close proximity, channelling their powers into their patron to grant them even greater fortitude.",

Old beyond imagining, no aelf can recall who sculpted Avalenor’s war-form, for the Stoneheart King seems to have simply marched out of myth. He glows with radiant might, and his sacred Firestealer Hammers channel all the freezing wrath of Hysh’s highest peaks. Even those foes who keep their distance are not safe, for in extremis, Avalenor can summon great blasts of stony debris and crushing earth to hurl across entire battlefields.\n\nAvalenor’s wisdom is beyond measure, and no few Lumineth princes and sages owe their rise to his blessings. Yet Avalenor has suffered greatly over the centuries. During the war against Nagash, the Great Necromancer performed a ritual of demise upon Avalenor’s mountain-form, sending his war-construct flaking to nothing. Eventually, Avalenor returned, striding out of the mists and into the fray once more in an apparent miracle. But while Lumineth society rejoices, those closest to Avalenor grow more concerned, as he is prone to mutter in elder tongues or stare off vacantly into the horizon. Some whisper that scars of Nagash may still linger upon his soul.",

As little more than children, they passed the sense-warping Trial of the Mindrazor. As they grew to adolescence, Ellania proved able to face down the most learned opponents in symposium debates, while Ellathor triumphed in back-to-back Vanari duelling contests. Teclis soon saw in these siblings echoes of him and his own brother. What this might portend, even the Archmage does not know, but Teclis is not one to discount the symmetry of fate. After much deliberation and testing, the twin gods dubbed them Eclipsian Warsages, champions who would travel far and fight to enact the will of their gods while seeking to temper their natural ability with wisdom.\n\nTo aid them, both twins received potent gifts. Ellania was bequeathed the staff Dianaer, whose realmstone head is said to capture the light of pure potential, as well as her faithful avian companion Atheane. Ellathor was granted the aetherquartz sword Altairi from Tyrion’s own arsenal. The twins now travel across the realms carrying out missions for the aelven gods. In battle, whichever sibling is more adept at quelling the enemy takes the lead, allowing them to excel regardless of whether magic or blade is required most.",

The arrows of the Hurakan are carried upon these living gales. They are able to slip around defences or through the narrowest gaps with unearthly precision, before suddenly accelerating to embed themselves in the vulnerable throats and eye sockets of stunned enemies. Even in close quarters, the Windchargers perform their deadly art, for their arrows have far less distance to travel and far less force to waste.\n\nTo keep pace with the wind is no easy feat, and so the Windchargers seek the allegiance of treerunners, Hyshian beasts that revel in chasing the aetheric breeze. Such is their grace that they can dart through the upper boughs of the realm’s forests as if gravity holds no sway over them. When working as one, an aelf and treerunner can pass through even the most fearsome melees as a graceful blur, the rider loosing volley after volley in lethal close quarters before their mount darts away.",

They have bonded with the winds so closely that to walk upon earth now feels unsettling, leading them to travel upon minor cloud spirits. This is not a matter of mastery but of symbiosis; while the Windmage gains an immortal companion, the spirit – otherwise prone to blowing every which way on the merest excitable whim – is guided by the aelf’s will and the power of their aspiragillum wand, granting them the focus to explore lands that their own flighty nature would never normally allow them to reach.\n\nIt is on the field of battle that a Windmage truly shines. Though a breeze may feel soft and playful, it can turn bitter in a moment; a Windmage may artfully manipulate it to carry arrows with lethal precision or to force air into a foe’s lungs until they burst. The wind carries shouted orders from different portions of a battlefield or else sees them drowned out, bringing dissolution and anarchy to a battleline. Many Windmages are seen as unpredictable tricksters by fellow aelves, but this is more a statement of wary respect than condemnation, for to decry the wind’s amusements will quickly see one swept into its lethal embrace.",

Yet in private, this mask begins to slip, and the Lord Regent Supreme’s grief wells to the surface.\n\nIn the early decades of the Age of Sigmar, Lyrior was commanded to lead the defence of Tor Limina. Yet in doing so, he was forced to leave his home city woefully vulnerable. Lyrior was to pay the price for his loyalty; upon returning, he found the city obliterated by greenskin raiders. When Uthralle discovered the brutalised remains of his beloved kin, something broke within him. Even now he screams into the void each night; only the spiritual ministrations of a trio of Cathallars keep his soul intact. Lyrior now funnels his torment into deeds, riding out to command almost every battle Ymetrica wages against the orruks in person and venting his hatred.",

Yet in the Age of Chaos, Sevireth was lured into a series of volcanic caverns by Slaaneshi cultists and sealed within, left to rage trapped and impotent. When the Lumineth at last freed him, the wind spirit was filled with a terrifying ire, his pride leading him on a rampage.\n\nThankfully, Sevireth’s anger appears to be mostly directed against Hysh’s enemies.

He recreated the warrior’s legendary Fangsword and armour before creating a doppelgänger to house Eltharion’s soul, yet this form burnt to ash upon coming into contact with that most luminous essence.

He is a masterful duellist, striking and feinting in close combat as fluidly as the wind itself.

To send an arrow soaring into the sky, its tip glimmering with purest light before descending to deliver judgement upon the unworthy, speaks to the souls of the aelves – as does the ability to strike down foes before being sullied by their presence. It is the task of the Auralan Sentinels to ensure that grinding melee rarely becomes a necessity, and they train fastidiously to squeeze every iota of potential from their bows and arrows.\n\nOf course, being aelves, the Sentinels have sought to improve upon the classical design of the bow as far as possible. Their efforts have resulted in the triple‑stringed arcbow, a weapon whose unique capacity for curvature and pull grants it two different modes of function: arrows can either be sent arcing skyward over distances that seem unbelievable to less enlightened mortals or else fired in a straight shot and with enough force to pin several warriors together. Sentinels forge their arrow tips from precious sunmetal to better ensure each shot flies true and pierces its mark.",

In battle, the Bladelords serve with quiet, unflinching pride, driving the enemy back with perfectly placed strikes that allow the Scinari to practise their arcane rites undisturbed. When surrounded by unending ranks of foes, they can change style effortlessly to instead land a flurry of blows that can slice through hordes with ease.\n\nIn turn, the Scinari seek to further uplift the minds of their guardians. Bladelords are encouraged to see battle as a complex equation, where momentum, force and reaction must all be balanced in a split second. Successful calculation of these competing forces sees the Bladelords wield their lightweight greatswords and twin blades to lop off limbs and heads in whirling strikes, each clumsy blow from their adversaries accounted for and countered with the perfect riposte. The Bladelords frown upon boastfulness even more so than other Lumineth; as they see it, their only duty is to protect their wizardly charges.

The stallions ridden by the Dawnriders are thoroughbreds from the wide plains of Xintil, independent creatures possessed of greater intellect than their equine peers. They are not broken in conventionally; instead, they choose to stand alongside aelves they deem worthy, which ensures that both aelf and steed possess a keen instinct for the other’s intentions.

Each Regent spends countless hours studying matters of strategy, allowing them to make quick calls during battle, and they are adept at channelling solar energies into their warriors’ sunmetal blades until they blaze with captured light. The trials by which a Regent earns their rank are taxing in the extreme. Tracking down and earn the allegiance of a lightcourser, a swift-footed quadruped energised by Hysh’s radiance, is but one of these.
