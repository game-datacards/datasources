Once a void shield has lost a shield point, it must continue to lose shield points due to any further damage inflicted until it collapses. Each time an attack causes a void shield to be reduced to 0 shield points, that void shield collapses: this model loses that void shield and any excess damage inflicted by that attack is lost. Void shields can never be used to prevent mortal wounds (each mortal wound inflicted on a model with void shields causes that model to lose one wound as normal).  \n  \nAt the start of your Command phase, if this model has a void shield that has fewer than 3 shield points remaining, that void shield is restored to 3 shield points."

The number you roll is the value of that Miracle dice. This value cannot be changed or re-rolled, unless a rule specifically states otherwise. Keep your Miracle dice to one side - this is your Miracle dice pool.  \n  \n**Designer’s Note:** _We recommend using differently coloured or marked dice for your Miracle dice pool, and placing them to one side of the battle.field, or some place else where you will not accidentally pick them up midgame. It is perfectly fine, if you wish, to write down the values of the Miracle dice in your pool, or to keep track of them in any other way, just so long as both players can see them._  \n  \nPerforming an Act of Faith  \nBefore making a dice roll for a model or a unit from your army with the Acts of Faith ability, if you have one or more dice in your Miracle dice pool, that unit can perform an Act of Faith. To do so, select one or more of the dice from your Miracle dice pool, instead of making any or all of those dice rolls. For each individual dice that is being rolled as part of the dice roll, you can select 1 Miracle dice from your Miracle dice pool to be substituted in place of that dice. The dice that it is being substituted for is not rolled, and instead the value of the selected Miracle dice is used as if it had been rolled. Each Miracle dice can only be selected for substitution once. Once all Miracle dice substitutions have been made, remove the chosen Miracle dice from your Miracle dice pool, and roll any remaining, unsubstituted dice that are a part of the dice roll. You can use Miracle dice when a unit performs an Act of Faith for any of the following types of dice roll:  \n* Advance roll\n* Charge roll\n* Hit roll\n* Wound roll\n* Saving throw\n* Damage roll\n* Morale test\nA Miracle dice is not a modifier or an inherently modified dice (so, for example, if you use a Miracle dice with a value of 1 for a Morale test, that is considered to be an unmodified roll of 1). A Miracle dice that has been used for a substitution can never be re-rolled. This means that if any re-rolls occur, the number and values of any Miracle dice that have already been substituted in the dice roll remain the same for the re-roll (for example, if a single Miracle dice was used to substitute one of the values of a charge roll, and the charge roll was re-rolled, only the unsubstituted dice can be re-rolled).  \n  \n_**Example 1:** Instead of rolling one D6 to see what value is added to a unit’s Move characteristic when that unit Advances, you could use a dice from your Miracle dice pool. If the value of that dice was 5, you would add 5\" to the Move characteristic of every model in that unit for that Movement phase._ \n  \n_**Example 2:** Instead of rolling 2D6 to see what a unit’s charge distance is when making a charge roll, you could use either one or two dice from your Miracle dice pool. If you chose 2 Miracle dice, and the values of those dice were a 6 and a 3, the unit’s charge distance would be 9\"._"

A CHARACTER who owes allegiance to one of the Dark Gods can only attempt to summon the units of their patron – for example, a KHORNE CHARACTER could only attempt to summon KHORNE DAEMONS.  \n  \nRoll up to 3 dice – this is your summoning roll. You can summon one new unit with the Daemonic Ritual ability to the battlefield that has a Power Rating equal to or less than the total result so long as it has the same Chaos God keyword you chose at the start (in the case of units that have a choice of allegiance, such as Furies, the unit when summoned will have this keyword). This unit is treated as reinforcements for your army and can be placed anywhere on the battlefield that is wholly within 12\" of the character and more than 9\" from any enemy model. If the total rolled is insufficient to summon any unit, the ritual fails and no new unit is summoned.  \n  \nIf your summoning roll included any doubles, your character then suffers a mortal wound. If it contained any triples, it instead suffers D3 mortal wounds."

He selects the following, writing them down on his army roster:_ \n_* Battle Round 1 = 2 (Sudden Storm)_\n_* Battle Round 2 = 3 (Vengeful Stars)_\n_* Battle Round 3 = 5 (Undying Legions)_\n_* Battle Round 4 = 4 (Hungry Void)_\n_* Battle Round 5+ = 1 (Eternal Guardian)_\n_**Designers Note**: If you have a set of Necrons Datacards, you can instead assign your command protocols by selecting the five corresponding cards you wish to use and placing them in a face-down deck in an order such that - by turning over the top card at the start of each battle round - you reveal the command protocol that will be active for your army that battle round._  \n  \nAt the start of each battle round, if any NECRONS CHARACTER units from your army are on the battlefield, the command protocol that you assigned to that battle round becomes active for your army until the end of that battle round. Each command protocol is made up of two directives. When a command protocol becomes active for your army, reveal it to your opponent and select one of its directives. Until the assigned command protocol stops being active, while a unit that is eligible to benefit from this ability is on the battlefield, that unit benefits from the selected directive.  \n  \nIn addition, if all units from your army are from the same dynasty (excluding DYNASTIC AGENT, C’TAN SHARD and UNALIGNED units), select one command protocol that has not been assigned to a battle round (there will typically only be one). That command protocol is active in every battle round in addition to the one assigned to that battle round – select which directive your units will benefit from at the start of each battle round. Note that if this additional command protocol is the one described in your dynasty’s code, this means both of its directives apply to all units with this ability in your army in every battle round, in addition to the protocol assigned to that battle round. The available command protocols are shown below.  \n  \n**Designer’s Note:** _Some rules refer to ‘the active command protocol’, in these instances these rules refer to all command protocols that are active for your army._   \n $Table$"

She selects Calistus stance 2 to be active._ \n  \n_In her fourth Command phase, she must select Calistus stance 1 to be active, as it is the only remaining stance she is able to select.

To do so, roll up to six D6\\. If every result is unique, you gain a number of additional Luck re-rolls equal to the number of D6 rolled. Each Luck re-roll can be used to re-roll one hit roll, wound roll, damage roll, saving throw or Advance roll made for a unit from your army with the Luck of the Laughing God ability. Any Luck re-rolls not used by the end of that battle round are lost.  \n  \n_**Example:** Wes is playing a Strike Force battle. Because of this, Wes gains 3 Luck re-rolls at the start of the battle round. Wes then makes a Luck of the Laughing God roll and decides to roll three D6\\. He rolls a 1, 3 and 5\\. Because each of these results is unique, until the end of that battle round Wes gains an additional 3 Luck re-rolls, for a total of 6._  \n  \n The Balance Dataslate  \nIgnore the table listed in the Luck of the Laughing God ability. Instead, at the start of the battle, you gain 0 Luck re-rolls, regardless of the battle size. You can only gain Luck re-rolls by making a Luck of the Laughing God roll."
